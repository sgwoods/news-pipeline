# Changelog

Releases of the AI Briefing pipeline. Versions are `0.MINOR.PATCH` while in beta: a MINOR release adds features,
a PATCH release fixes problems. Changes are built and tested on a development branch and reach production
together as a release (docs/plans/release-process.md).

## Unreleased

## v0.1.0-beta · 2026-10-22
The system as it runs today, labelled the first beta: a small number of outside readers.

- Daily edition: fetch from feeds, sitemaps, Bluesky lists, newsletters and Slack links; filter, summarize, rank,
  cluster into stories, critique, verify and fact-check; Top of mind, Must read, Worth knowing, Open questions.
- Evidence-weighted sources: every source has a profile, and a Must read needs primary or reporting evidence.
- Podcast: a ~10-minute episode read by the host, followed in the same episode by the day's deep dive.
- Public site, podcast feed and RSS on GitHub Pages; a subscriber email sent after the site is live.
- Release gate on every outbound step: tests, secret scan, privacy invariants and Steven's approval of
  security-sensitive changes; owner alerts when action is needed; a cloud watchdog for missing editions.
- Reader feedback collected from email replies and triaged daily.
- Public code repository: an allowlisted, scrubbed export (`./np push-code`), MIT licence.
